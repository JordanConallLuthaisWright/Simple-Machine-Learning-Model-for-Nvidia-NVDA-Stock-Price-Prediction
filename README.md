# Simple Stock Price Prediction ML Model for Nvidia (NVDA) [Feb 2025]

***(Dataset taken from Yahoo Finance)***

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on **predicting Nvidia (NVDA) stock price movements** using **machine learning models**. By analyzing **historical stock market data**, the model aims to classify whether the stock price will **increase or decrease** the next day.

By leveraging **data preprocessing, feature engineering, backtesting, and predictive modeling**, this project explores the potential of **AI in financial forecasting**. Key tasks include **creating moving averages, trend indicators, and testing multiple classification models**, ensuring a structured approach to financial data analysis.

The structured datasets support **investment decision-making, algorithmic trading, and risk management**, demonstrating practical **machine learning applications** in financial markets.

The goal is to **train and evaluate a model that predicts** whether Nvidia's stock price will rise or fall the following day.
