## **Business Context & Problem Statement**  
Nvidiaâ€™s stock price has **shown strong growth trends**, but also **high volatility**, making it difficult to predict short-term movements. This project explores whether **machine learning models** can capture **price trends and momentum indicators** to improve forecasting.

### **Key Challenges:**  
- **Financial markets are highly unpredictable.**  
- **Machine learning models need meaningful historical features** to make informed predictions.  
- **Backtesting is essential** to ensure the model performs reliably over unseen data.  

---

## **Methodology & Technical Steps**  

### **1. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**  
- **Extracted historical stock prices** from Yahoo Finance.  
- **Created rolling averages** to capture long-term trends.  

### **2. Feature Engineering**  
- **Moving Averages** (2, 5, 60, 250, 1000-day periods).  
- **Trend Indicators**: Count of previous **up-days to measure momentum**.  
- **Binary Target Creation**: `1` if the price increases, `0` otherwise.  

### **3. Model Training & Evaluation**  
- **Random Forest Classifier** as the **baseline model**.  
- **Tuned hyperparameters** for better performance.  
- **Evaluated with precision scores and classification metrics**.  

### **4. Backtesting Approach**  
- **Tested model over multiple historical periods**.  
- **Evaluated whether predictions aligned with actual stock movements**.  

---

## **Key Takeaways & Impact**  
- **Stock price prediction is complex**, but **feature engineering improves model accuracy**.  
- **Early model performance achieved ~51.7% precision** (near random).  
- **Feature Engineering boosted precision to 56.7%**, highlighting the importance of **trend signals**.  
- **Backtesting provided real-world validation** of model effectiveness.

## **Future Enhancements**  

### **1. Deep Learning Models**  
- Implement **LSTMs or GRUs** for better **time-series forecasting**.  

### **2. Incorporate Macroeconomic Factors**  
- Include **earnings reports, Federal Reserve decisions, and global economic data**.  

### **3. Test Alternative Machine Learning Models**  
- Compare **XGBoost, SVM, and Logistic Regression** to assess model performance.  

### **4. Live Data Testing**  
- Apply predictions on **real-time stock data** for validation.
